# OTT-Platform

This is an movies site where number of movies are displayed with their posters. I have done this using HTML, CSS and Java script , where API key is used for bringing the content for multiple movies from a OTT platform.

We have a search option that can be used to sort the movies based on user's preference. 

Steps to execute the code:-
  - Clone the repository to your PC.
  - Make sure the filenames and locations are matching in the HTML file.
  - Open the HTMl file using a browser to see the project.
  - To edit the code use any softwares that can modify HTML files (Ex: Notepad, VSCode, replit...)
